# IFTTT extensions

This is a placeholder repo for a future project regarding extending IFTTT with JavaScript scripts.

This was created because in the discussion of [kaplas/ifttt-channel-extensions #1](/kaplas/ifttt-channel-extensions/issues/1) what is actually the future of extending IFTTT with custom scripts. Please feel free to star this repository; I try to get something concreate here as soon as possible.
